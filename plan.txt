Download sheets I need as .json
Read the inputs from .json
Make the calculations from "Data" json in Python
	Crucial you do not save this information
	Calculate every time you want to look at input
	Make sure it works
Done with Python for now lol

Build a database in SQL
	Holds ONLY the inputs
Put input information into the database
Go back to Python, change it from using .json to the database

STRETCH GOAL POG
Make it so Python can insert new data (append or overwrite) (insert vs. modify)
